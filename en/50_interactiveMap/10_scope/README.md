The target group for this document are requirements analysts, IT product manager, departmental staff affected by IT projects, IT project manager and IT architects.

## Scope and Limits
Liferay is an OpenSource project hosted at GitHub. So this feature is founded on git and GitHubs features. The same holds for Leaflet.
